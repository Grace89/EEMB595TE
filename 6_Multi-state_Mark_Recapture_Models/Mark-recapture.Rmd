## Example of Multi-state systems

The example listed here are not all inclusive:

- Age structure: baby, juvenile, adult, dead

- Disease: infected, not infected, dead

- Movement: location A, location B, dead

- Sexual maturity: 

  - Fruiting adult, not fruiting adult, dead
  
  - Breeding adult, not breeding adult, dead
  
- Plant state: vegetative, flowering, dormant

## Types of Multi-state Mark-recapture models

These are the two most popular mark-recapture models are:

  - Cormack-Jolly-Seber Model (CJS)
    
  - Jolly-Seber Model (JS)
    
There are others:

  - But most of them stem from variations of these models

What parameters can you estimate using these two models?

| Cormack-Jolly-Seber Model | Jolly-Seber |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Survival ($\phi_{1}$)         | Survival ($\phi_{1}$) |           
| Survival ($\phi_{2}$)         | Survival ($\phi_{2}$) |           
| Transistion probability ($\psi_{1,2}$)| Transistion probability ($\psi_{1,2}$) |  
| Transistion probability ($\psi_{2,1}$)| Transistion probability ($\psi_{2,1}$) |  
|                             | Recruitment ($\gamma_{1}$) |  
|                             | Recruitment ($\gamma_{2}$) |  
|                             | Abundance (*N*) |  

What is the main difference between the CJS and JS models?

The Cormack-Jolly-Seber model disregards the data prior to the first encounter:

  - So it can not estimate recruitment
    
  - y = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

  - The model will start using information from the fourth season when the individual was captured (0 = not seen; 1 = seen)

The Jolly-Seber model uses the entire capture history:

  - So it can not estimate recruitment
    
  - y = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

  - The model will take advantage of the entire capture history- starting with the first season
        
    - It needs to determine was the organism present at the site and not seen (false negative) and if so- was this when it was recruited.
    
<br>

## Model assumptions

(1) Cormack-Jolly-Seber Model

  - The transition and observation probabilities must be the same for all individuals at a given occasion and state 
  
  - Individuals must be independent from one another
  
  - Individuals and states are recorded without error
  
    - If this is the case, look into multi-event models
      
  - No marks are lost
  
(2) Jolly-Seber Model

  - Same as the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model plus 2 more
  
  - The captured individuals are a random sample of the population
  
    - i.e., there is no trapping method does not affect the probability of recapturing

  - *All* individuals (marked and unmarked) in the population have the same capture probability
  
    - This is met when the same protocol is used each season

## Collecting data for animals that could be in one of 2 states

- State process: Unobserved (truth)

- Observed process: Observed (with sampling error)

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/6_Multi-state_Mark_Recapture_Models/Fig7_1.png") 
```

- Where y = 1 (seen) and y = 0 (not seen)

- The observations for one individual would be:
  
  - y = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  
- We need to determine if the individual for the last 3 sampling periods was dead or alive and not seen

- We monitor several individuals so the data we collect will look like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
mat <- matrix(rbinom(50, 1, 0.7), ncol = 5, nrow = 10)
colnames(mat) <- c("Season1", "Season2", "Season3", "Season4", "Season5")
rownames(mat) <- 1:10
mat
```

<br>

## Collecting data for animals that could be in one of 3 states

- State process: Unobserved (truth)

- Observed process: Observed (with sampling error)

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/6_Multi-state_Mark_Recapture_Models/Fig9_1.png") 
```

- Where y = 1 (seen in state 1), y = 2 (seen in state 2), and y = 0 (not seen)

  - You define and categorize what does state 1 equal and what does state 2 equal

- The observations for one individual would be:
  
  - y = [1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  
- We need to determine if the individual for the last 3 sampling periods was dead or alive and not seen

- We monitor several individuals so the data we collect will look like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
mat <- matrix(rmultinom(50, 2, c(0.3, 0.4, 0.3)), ncol = 5, nrow = 10)
colnames(mat) <- c("Season1", "Season2", "Season3", "Season4", "Season5")
rownames(mat) <- 1:10
mat
```

## Working exampling

We are interested in disease state of the chytrid fungus (infected or not infected) for amphibians.

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/6_Multi-state_Mark_Recapture_Models/S_ilex.jpg") 
```

Data collection methods:
  
  - We go out 1 night for 10 years
  
  - We give individuals unique IDs (using toe clipping method)
  
  - We collect skin swab samples from individuals to determine in the lab the disease state

## Model outline

We denote the true but, unknowable, disease state of individual *i* at occasion *t* as $z_{i,t}$, where $z_{i,t} = 1\ldots4$ and represents the states "not entered", "uninfected", "infected", or "dead", respectively. To estimate monthly survival $(\phi)$, recruitment $(\gamma)$, and transition $(\beta)$ rates, we used the transition matrix $\psi$, where the cells represent the probabilities of moving from a row state to a column state from time *t-1* to time *t* for individual *i*.

<br><center>
<div style="width:525px; height=525px">
![](psiMatrix.png)
</center>
<br>

The “not entered” category consists of individuals that are not part of the population yet, where the parameters $\gamma_{2}$ and $\gamma_{3}$ are the state-specific entry probabilities for uninfected and infected hosts from *t-1* to *t*, i.e., the probability that an individual in state *i* enters the population at time *t*. The parameter $\phi_{2}$ and $\phi_{3}$ are the state-specific survival probability for uninfected  and infected hosts from *t-1* to *t*, while the parameters $\beta_{UI}$ and $\beta_{IU}$ are the infection and recovery probabilities, respectively. In other words, if the individual *i* survives from *t-1* to *t*, it can become infected if they were uninfected at *t-1*, or recover from infection if there were infected at time *t-1*, with probabilities $\beta_{UI}$ and $\beta_{IU}$. Each parameter must be between [0,1] and each group of parameters (recruitment, survival, and transition) must sum to 1. For survival and transition this is easy. However, for recruitment this is less straightforward. One solution is to choose a Dirichlet prior for $[\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2}, \gamma_{3}]$ to ensure that these parameters sum to 1.

Because there are more than two possible true and observed states, we use the categorical distribution to model the transition from one state to another for individual *i* each time step:

$$z_{i,t} \mid z_{i,t-1} \sim \textrm{categorical}(\psi_{z_{i,t-1},1:4}),$$

where $\psi$ is the transition matrix we just defined. Note that the argument of the categorical distribution is a vector of length 4; that is, it is the row of the matrix $\psi$ corresponding to the state of individual *i* in time step *t-1*.

To estimate host recapture probabilities, we use a second transition matrix $\pi$, which determines the probabilities of the possible observation outcomes (columns) for the true state of each captured individual (rows). We do not assume partial observations or state misclassifications and the observed states are "seen uninfected", "seen infected", and "not seen".

<br><center>
<div style="width:400px; height=400px">
![](piMatrix.png)
</center>
<br>

We use the categorical to model the observed state $y_{i,t}$ as a function of the true state:

$$y_{i,t} \mid z_{i,t} \sim \textrm{categorical}(\pi_{z_{i,t},1:3}),$$

where $\pi$ is the observation matrix we just defined.. Similarly as before, the argument of the categorical distribution is a vector of length 3; that is, it is the row of the matrix $\pi$ corresponding to the true state of individual *i* in time step *t*.

## Import our data and examine the data

```{r}
CH <- read.csv("/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/6_Multi-state_Mark_Recapture_Models/Data/data_amphibian.csv")[,-1]
```

Look at the structure of the data and make sure it was imported correctly

```{r}
str(CH)
```

Remember our observations:
  - 0 = not seen
  - 1 = seen as uninfected
  - 2 = seen as infected

```{r}
head(CH)
```

## JAGS model

** Note that this code has a Bayesian posterior predictive check code and we will ignore it for now **

*Quick note the Bayesian posteriod predictive check or also known as the Bayesian p-value is used to evaluate how well does your data match predictions from the model you created. Values near 0.5 = well fitting model; whereas values near 0.95 and 0.05 = poor fitting model*
