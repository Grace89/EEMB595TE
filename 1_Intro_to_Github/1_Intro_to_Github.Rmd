## Objectives

(1) To learn how to obtain class materials using the terminal (Mac)/command prompt (Windows)

(2) To learn what is Git, Github, GitDesktop, and Rstudio

<br>

## Accessing the course materials

GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. There are a few things that you will need to do to get going with git/GitHub. Mainly, you must create free a GitHub account and get your machine ready to interact with your account. 

Github is the web interface of Git. 

<br>

## Cloning the course repository to your computer

Open terminal/bash and navigate to the directory where you would like to hold the course materials. If you are not familiar or comfortable using the command line, we **highly** recommend using the root directory. For the rest of this quick intro, we will refer to the path to your root directory as ``rootPath``.  

1.  To navigate quickly to the root directory type the following terminal/bash window:

    ```bash
    cd 
    ```

2.  To clone the course repository into your current directory paste the following into your terminal/bash window: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Grace89/EEMB595TE.git
    ```

<br>

## Updating the course materials each week

We plan to update the course repository on a regular basis. It is likely that you will need to update your materials several times per day.  To do this you will ``pull`` a current copy of the repository. To do this: 

1.  You'll need to open your terminal/bash.

2.  Navigate to the course repository. If this is in your root directory then type:

    ```bash
    cd
    cd EEMB595TE
    ```
    
3.  Paste the following into the terminal/bash:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

<br>

## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Using course materials 

Each time you ``pull`` and updated version of the course repository your local machine will have a clean (untouched) copy of **all** course materials.  **Therefore, if you modify the course materials it is extremely important that you save your work under a different name.**  If you fail to save your work with a new name, your work will be **lost** the next time you ``pull`` to get the most up-to-date materials. Where you choose to save your work doesn't matter. You can choose a brand new directory or you can save within the directory that you've created for our course. 

Inevitably, you will make an inadvertent or deliberate change to a file in the course materials. In this case, your ``pull`` will fail. To remedy this:

1.  You'll need to open your terminal/bash.

2.  Execute the following simple steps one at a time in your terminal/bash:

    ```bash
    git checkout .
    git pull
    ```

## Before starting

Before starting this tutorital, you will need to download several pieces of software:

- RStudio

      https://www.rstudio.com/
      
- Git

      https://git-scm.com/downloads
      
- GitDesktop
      
      - New Version
      https://desktop.github.com/
      
      - Old Mac version:
      https://central.github.com/mac/latest
      
      - Old Windows version:
      https://www.filehorse.com/download-github-desktop/old-versions/

## What is Git?

- Most widely used version control system

- Actively maintained, open source project

- Originally developed in 2005

- Git with what underlies Github

<br>

## What is Github? And why use it?

- Github: a web interface for Git

- Version control
  
    - Keeps track of deletions/additions to code
    
    - Shows changes that collaboratos have made
    
    - Have 1 file rather than 20 with different names, date, and version numbers 

- Good workflow with collaborators
    
    - One location for:
        
        - Code
        
        - Collaborator discussions

- Reproducible and transparent methods and results

    - You can post PDFs, code, and data all in a single location for others to use
    
    - If posted prior to peer-review of manuscript, the reviewer can look at the code and more effectively evaluate and interpret what you are doing/saying in your methods
    
- Need more convinving? Read the tale of Julia Stewart at NCEAS 
  
    - "Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools"
    
    - PDF available in this repository

<br>

## Why Github Desktop?

- Another way to use version control if you don't like the Rstudio-Github connection

- Open-source

- Cross-platform experience

<br>

## Why RStudio?

- Partitions windows nicely (unlike R)

    - All relevent windows are docked in a single application window
    
- Graphical workspace

    - Rather than typing ls() to see the objects in your local environment; you can see the objects you've created
    
    - You can also click on the object and it will  show you the object.
    
- Text Editor included

- Cross-platform interface
  
      - Windows, Mac, etc.

- Tab-completion of filenames, function names, and arguments

      - When you start typing a name, then hit tab, and RStudio will autocomplete the word (saves you from typos!)

- Produces seamless Rmarkdown files using knitr

      - You can embed code to make the file easy to read for collaborators (or classes)

## Connecting RStudio and Github

**(1) Tell Rstudio who you are on Github**

In Rstudio, *Tools* -> *Version Control*, select *Git*

Then, *Tools* -> *Global Options* select *Git/SVN* tab
Ensure that the path to the executable is correct (i.e., correct paths to git and to SVN).
This is especially importnat for *Windows* where it may not default correctly (e.g., C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe)

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git1.png" style="position:center"/>

Now hit * Create RSA Key*

Close that window

Click on *View public key* and copy the displayed public key.

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git2.png" style="position:center"/>

Now- open your Github account settings and click the SSH keys tab. 

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git3.jpeg" style="position:center"/>

Click on *Add SSH key*

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git4.jpeg" style="position:center"/>

**(2) Tell Git who you are on your local Rstudio**
*Note, Git is a piece of software running on your computer.*
*Github is an online repository*

In Rstudio, click on *Tools* -> *Shell*

Then enter:
```{r}
# $ git config --global user.email "your email"

# $ git config --global user.name "your github username"
```
**(3) Create a project**

In Rstudio, click on *File* -> *New project* -> *New Directory*

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git5.png" style="position:center"/>

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git6.png" style="position:center"/>

Name the project *Test* and *Check a git repository*

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git7.png" style="position:center"/>

Now, in RStudio, create a new script (*File* -> *R Script*)

In the text editor, write:
"#Test Script"

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git8.png" style="position:center"/>

Then, *Save* the Project.

Now, in the "Environment/history panel", there should be a Git tab. Click on the square box next to "Test.R". This will make the yellow question marks turn into a single green A status. 

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git9.png" style="position:center"/>

Now, click on "Commit".

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git10.png" style="position:center"/>

You have now committed the current version of this file to your repository on your computer/server. 

**(4) Pushing the conents of this commit to Github**

Go to your Github account to create a New Repository.
Go to your profile.

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git11.png" style="position:center"/>

Then, hit *New* in the upper right.

Then, name this repository *Test*

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git12.png" style="position:center"/>

Hit *Create repository*

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git16.jpeg" style="position:center"/>

Copy and past the Repository URL and the SSH

Back in RStudio, click on *Tools* -> *Shell*

```{r}
# $ git remote add origin <Repository URL>

# $ git config remote.origin.url <Repository SSH>

# $ git push -u origin master

# $ git pull origin master

```

*Beware, this is the tricky part to get RStudio to allow you connect to Github. You may need to do some google searching on how to get it to work*

If you are getting errors with the commands above, try the following:

```{r}
# $ git remote add <Repository URL>

# $ git config remote.origin.url <Repository SSH> 

# $ git push -u origin master --force

# $ git pull origin master

```

## Github Desktop

New Github Desktop:
https://desktop.github.com/

But I could not get the new version to work on my Mac:

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git14.png" style="position:center"/>

Old Mac version:
https://central.github.com/mac/latest

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/Git15.png" style="position:center"/>

The idea here is to link a local folder as a Github repository. Whenever you make changes to that repository, they appear in Github Desktop. Then you need to commit the change and sync.

To do this, Open the program and link your github account to it. I will be using the older version here. 

This is what a clean interface looks like:

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/GitD1.png" style="position:center"/>

To clone a repository from your Guthub, go to the upper had + sign and chose the repository:

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/GitD2.png" style="position:center"/>

Then it will clone the repository to your local machine. It will have a history of all the changes you had to the documents:

<img src="/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/1_Intro_to_Github/GitD3.png" style="position:center"/>

Lastly, go about making changes to your documents as normal, then go to the github desktop, create a commit, *hit commit*, and then *sync*. This will update the latest version on your Github.
